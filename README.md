# Insertion Sort Assignment

This project contains a full implementation and analysis of the Insertion Sort algorithm. It includes performance testing under various scenarios and demonstrations of stability and time complexity.

## Files

- `insertion_sort.py` – Core sorting function
- `test_cases.py` – Tests sorting on small, large, reversed, and nearly sorted arrays
- `stable_sort_demo.py` – Demonstrates algorithm stability
- `average_case_analysis.py` – Tests average-case performance
- `report.txt` – Full analysis and reflection report

## How to Run

1. Make sure all files are in the same directory.
2. Run any file with `python3 filename.py` from your terminal.

## Requirements

- Python 3
